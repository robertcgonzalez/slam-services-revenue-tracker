# SLAM Services Revenue Tracker

**Live Application**: [https://slam-services-revenue-tracker.azurewebsites.net/](https://slam-services-revenue-tracker.azurewebsites.net/)

**Purpose**: Operational backbone for SLAM Services LLC bookkeeping. Reduces manual revenue chasing, automates bank statement processing (with intelligent check linking and persistent payee rules), and provides real-time visibility into revenue requests and missing documentation. Built for Laura & Stef as daily drivers, with a clean handoff path to Patty & Robert.

**Single Source of Truth**: `SLAM Services - Digital Transformation Blueprint.md` (complete history, architecture decisions, and Change Log).

## Quick Start

### Local Windows (primary)

All development and testing runs on your machine. There is no Docker or GitHub Codespaces dev-container path in this repo.

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.10 (`py -3.10`), Git, and [poppler for Windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases) (`pdftoppm` on PATH).

```powershell
cd C:\SLAM-Services-Project
.\Scripts\PowerShell\Setup-LocalVenv.ps1 -InstallHeavyOcr
copy Scripts\spike\cv-read.env.sample .env   # edit AZURE_CV_* or SLAM_CV_CACHE_DIR
.\run_local.ps1
```

Open http://localhost:8501. For heavy OCR only after the base venv exists:

```powershell
.\Scripts\PowerShell\Install-LocalHeavyOcr.ps1
```

Full guide: [docs/local-development.md](docs/local-development.md). Environment policy: [docs/environment-policy.md](docs/environment-policy.md).

### Health checks

```powershell
python Scripts/health_check.py --full
.\Scripts\PowerShell\Check-AppHealth.ps1 -Full -CheckAzure   # pre-UAT / post-deploy
```

## Current Status (June 2026 — Post DI Go-Live)

### Production (Azure App Service — DI-only)

- **Bank Statements**: **Azure Document Intelligence only** when `AZURE_DI_*` App Settings are set. `App/app.py` hardcodes `run_mode = "azure_ocr"` and stops with a clear error if Azure DI is not configured — no processing-mode radios, no Local Enhanced path, no lightweight-parser fallback on the live UI.
- **DI pipeline**: Two-leg path in `App/bank_statements.py` + `App/azure_document_intelligence.py` — register via `prebuilt-bankStatement.us`, imaging via geometric cropper v5 + `prebuilt-check.us` per crop. Enablement: `Scripts/PowerShell/Set-AzureBankStatementDIAppSettings.ps1`; runbook: `docs/DI-Go-Live-Commands.md`, `docs/go-live-execution-runbook.md`.
- **Gate A3 (check/imaging leg)**: Infrastructure verified **2026-05-30** (HTTP 200, `IMAGING_LEG poppler=ok`, PostgreSQL 98 clients / 36 requests). Final **`SMOKE_EVIDENCE` verdict pending** — run `Collect-GateA3Evidence.ps1 -Both -UpdateDocs` after deploy + minimal browser smoke. Detail: `docs/handoffs/gate-a3-full-autonomous-closure-2026-05-30.md`.
- **Data layer**: Azure PostgreSQL (`USE_POSTGRES=true`); canonical schema in `db/schema.sql` and `docs/data-model.md`.
- **Daily driver (Laura/Stef)**: Dashboard, Revenue Requests, Bank Statements, payee rules on App Service (B2). QMS visibility in sidebar + `health_check.py --qms` (O-002, v2.44.21).

### Local Enhanced (Robert's Windows machine only)

- **Heavy OCR + hybrid CV**: `App/local_enhanced_ocr.py` — full intelligent check-linking pipeline, Azure CV Read on check crops when `AZURE_CV_*` or `SLAM_CV_CACHE_DIR` in `.env`. Install via `Setup-LocalVenv.ps1 -InstallHeavyOcr` / `Install-LocalHeavyOcr.ps1`. **Not wired into production Streamlit UI.**
- **G1 spike artifacts**: Phases 0–7 complete — canonical index [`Scripts/spike/README.md`](Scripts/spike/README.md) (v2.44.27).

### Parked / fallback

- **Azure OCR Function** (`slam-ocr-function`): parked; not the production path.
- **CSV mode**: zero-disruption fallback when Postgres is disabled (requires server-side CSVs — not for daily driver).

**Full history**: Blueprint Change Log (v2.30 → **v2.44.27**). State Alignment process: [`QMS/State-Alignment/process.md`](QMS/State-Alignment/process.md) (active since v2.44.9).

## Azure CV on check photos (Local Enhanced)

**Local Enhanced OCR** uses Azure Computer Vision Read on imaging-page check crops when `AZURE_CV_ENDPOINT` + `AZURE_CV_KEY` or `SLAM_CV_CACHE_DIR` are set in `.env` (see `Scripts/spike/cv-read.env.sample`). That is the **only** automated reader for crop images — EasyOCR is used for full-page tabular fallback only, never on individual check crops. Without CV creds or cache, crops are still produced for review but payee intelligence from photos is skipped.

## Documentation & Agent Workflow

**Cursor** is the **primary / lead** AI coding agent. **Grok** is the official **secondary** agent. Both follow the same rules.

When starting any agent session (Cursor or Grok), begin with:

> "Read CONSTITUTION.md first. Then reference the full SLAM Services Digital Transformation Blueprint.md (latest version) and this README.md. [Your request]"

### Documentation Roles Matrix

This is the **single authoritative map** of every document’s defined purpose. Content must live in exactly one place.

| Document | Primary Consumer | Defined Role & Purpose | What Belongs Here (and only here) | What Does **Not** Belong Here |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `SLAM Services - Digital Transformation Blueprint.md` | Humans + agents (deep reference) | **Living Single Source of Truth + complete project history**. The authoritative record of vision, architecture, decisions, roadmap, SDLC, and all major milestones. | Full Change Log (narrative history), executive summary, phased roadmap, technical architecture, stakeholder map, risk/decision logs, Section 14 feedback system, detailed "why" behind every significant change. | Day-to-day commands, quick-start recipes, injected agent constraints (keep thin), the "map" of which doc does what. |
| `README.md` | Humans (onboarding + daily reference) + agents (cross-reference) | **Practical human onboarding, current status snapshot, command reference, and the single authoritative "Documentation Roles & Agent Workflow" guide**. The one place anyone looks first to understand how to work with the project and where information lives. | Current status banner, Quick Start, local/Azure health recipes (entry points), this Documentation Roles Matrix, folder structure, project goals. Detailed procedural guides live in `docs/`. | Long historical narrative (belongs in Blueprint), hard agent prompt constraints (belong in the two injected contracts). |
| `.cursor/rules/slam-services.mdc` | Cursor (Composer / Agent / inline edit) — **always injected** | **Lean, self-contained primary agent contract**. Contains only the non-negotiable rules that must be in Cursor's context window on every invocation. | Agent role declaration (Cursor lead), reference to Blueprint + README, the two core standing orders (anti-bloat/role-respect + git via canonical `Invoke-GitVerification.ps1` + Prime Directive alignment for dual-agent), security/Laura-confidence, verification habits, tech stack pointers, one-sentence pointer to this matrix. | Long explanations, history, commands, the full matrix (pointer only). Must stay minimal. |
| `.grok/AGENT.md` | Grok 4.3 (this TUI and other Grok-assisted sessions) — **secondary agent** | **Official Grok secondary agent context** (canonical location). Carries the same hard constraints as the Cursor contract so Grok sessions stay consistent with project rules. | Same two core standing orders (anti-bloat + git via canonical `Invoke-GitVerification.ps1` + Prime Directive alignment), updated "Cursor primary + Grok secondary" reality, pointer to this matrix. Short and focused. | Anything that duplicates the Cursor contract or the human docs. |
